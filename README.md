## Overview
### Description
This app allows users to create a profile where they input their name, age, height/weight, picture, and bio. Users can interact and follow other users. There are different tabs in the app for users to enter data into an activity tracker, diet tracker, and well-being tracker. The activity tracker tracks how many minutes exercised and/or miles walked. The diet tracker tracks consumption such as how many cups of water and different meals throughout the day. The well-being tracker tracks how the user is feeling that day and how many hours of sleep they got.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Fitness, health, mental awareness
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily focused on mobile. It could be possible to use on a computer, but probably will not be viable for computer-use. Most of the features included will be on the mobile device.
- **Story:** This app allows for users to track their progress in their fitness goals and creates a competitive nature amongst friends to maintain their healthy habits.
- **Market:** Marketed to people who want to track their fitness goals and mental health.
- **Habit:** This app can be used to help develop and maintain strong fitness habits by allowing users to view fitness activity from their friends and allow them to want to continue their own fitness goals.
- **Scope:** First this app would be mostly advertised to people who have or want to have strong fitness habits. Then, the initial users would be able to help influence their friends to get the app to also start their own fitness journey.
